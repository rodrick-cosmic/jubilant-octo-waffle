<h3>Mario's archenemy? Or Invaluable asset in naivgating the interwebs?</h3>

<p class="yellow-div"> Browsers have an important role of functioning as an access point of sorts to the World Wide Web, they are essentially our means of transport to the internet, but they’re also so much more. Since their ‘conception’ browsers have become silent helpers in our daily lives and given they’re a gateway to the internet and a browser such as Google deals with approximately 3.8 million searches per minute on average across the globe it is no small feat to spend a day without using a browser at least once.

    However before we get into the nitty gritty of web browsers, allow me to differentiate between this and a search engine as many often use the terms interchangeably. The Internet is an endless sea of information & resources and to access these resources from the internet certain software programs known as Search Engines are used. From my understanding, a search engine can best be described as a website in which a user can search for any and all resources and material available on the Internet. To do this a user punches in keywords into the search field, thereafter the search engine looks through its index for web pages relating to the search query and then displays them in the form of a list of webpages. There consists of three distinct components of a web browser namely crawlers, an Index and a Search algorithm. Crawlers are software programs sometimes referred to as spiderbots or bots. These do regular scans of websites for URLs, keywords, and links in order to optimize user experience. Crawlers can follow links present on other webpages and given each crawler has their own unique identifier they are able to identify themselves to a web server. Relating to crawlers are Indexes which use crawlers to continuously scan websites, and develop an index of URLs, links and keywords to make the search results more effective. Lastly, we have the search algorithm which is the final cog in the search process. It works by searching for the aforementioned index and finding webpages by matching. </p>
