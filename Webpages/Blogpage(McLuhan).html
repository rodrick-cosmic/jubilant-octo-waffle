<h3>The Medium Is The Message, massage, or was it mass-age?</h3>

<p class="yellow-div"> Marshall McLuhan's seminal piece, The Medium Is The Message, is arguably one of the most prophetic and equally informative pieces of text in the 21st century. The phrase is somewhat paradoxical, shouldn't the medium be a mere vessel for the message? According to McLuhan, not really. McLuhan believes that it is better that we emphasis the content rather than its form, that what is communicated is far less important than the medium in which it was communicated through.

Take for instance a castaway who writes a letter and slips it into a bottle before throwing into the ocean. </p>

<p class="yellow-div">The bottle floats endlessly through high tides, still seas and even other castaways. <p class="yellow-div"><br> Eventually </br> The bottle washes ashore and a coast guard picks it up, the guard is stunned that the bottle was able to travel for as long as it has, he shows the bottle to his fellow coast guards and they all rejoice at this archaic sight, after much jubilation they break the bottle open and read the letter.

    Without the bottle, the letter would never have been received, without email, the letter would never have been received, without Facebook, the letter would never have been received, without Twitter, the letter would never have been received.
