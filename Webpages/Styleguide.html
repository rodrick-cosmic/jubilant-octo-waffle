          <h1> With the overall color palette for my website I thought having warm and cool hues combined to create a colorful yet not overwhelming feeling. I think the appeal came from how it created a very youthful and modern design. The light greens and earthy terracottas I think work to create a nice contrast that isn't too agressive.  </h1>

<h1> The two images above are screenshots of two websites whose color palettes I found to be very engaging and interesting. I liked how despite the colors being almost completely different they evoke this sense of unision and harmony through how different they are. </h1>

<h1>I came across this website through following YouTube tutorials around 3D modelling, as the website's creator is a 3D artist. The website is extremely simple and minimalistic, I liked the fact that the bright green was contrasted against the the black text. </H1>

    <h1>Above is the website that the bare bones of my designs originate from, partially because I followed a tutorial which helped build that site, and also because I just felt like the site was modern, sleek and retained a edge of professionalism despite feeling fun as well. </H1>

            <h1> This was the very first iteration of my website. It was very crude and basic with hardly any details.  I envisioned it having a log-in & sign-up screen. I also began thinking about how the website would look on a mobile device.</H1>

            <h1>This is the first wireframe I drafted after seeing the tutorial. With it I wanted to bring my own spin to the website and making it mine instead of just using the tutorial. Additionally, I thought some aspects would not be suited to what I wanted to do. </h1>

            <h1> I think this took me the longer to plot out and implement than I intially thought, because there were so many options to choose from, and it was not easy to find the exact one that I needed. However, the most difficult aspect, would definitely be how I needed conceptualize how a blog would look like and how I could fit it into my website.</h1>

            <h1> I wanted the portfolio section to look more like a catalogue, something you would see on Steam or Epic Games library, just to give it that game feel. Additionally, I wanted it to be more experimental and abstract than the rest of my site. </h1>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
            </div>

            <h1>
                In the moments leading up to writing this, I wondered if I should write one reflection for the technical aspect and one for the creative. I thought, why do that when although there is a distinction, they are both closely related, and in this context, dependent on each other. I will, however, divide this reflection into the creative and technical and just jump from them. So, I think the first and most important declaration is, this assignment was definitely one of the better ones so far. I think I liked how open-ended it was, where it was essentially up to me to decide what to put where, and how every last placement would be a means of communicating something or the other. It is, was and will forever be-daunting. And it adds a level of consequence to the entire debacle. 
                For the first time it felt like our works have a real world impact.
                <br></br>
                But I digress, you were asking about a technical reflection. Honestly, I have never been the strongest when it comes to programming and enrolling in this course, I wondered, could I manage with learning yet another programming language, when I barely survived C# for Game Design? I expected this course to be mainly practical application on how to get a website up-and-running, learn HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and do stuff web developers do. <br></br> Instead, I was bombarded with readings that made me question the very nature of the web and the effect it has had on the world. Which is by no means me detesting the notion, the opposite actually, I think it gave us the ability to look at website development from its social implications to its effects on users and creators alike, and how the concept of the ‘web’ existed for years before its initial conception, as something illusory and non-tangible. I think this block also showed how we as creators/designers need to be conscious of the industry and climate. It’s actually fascinating how once you make a deliberate effort to observe design principles you begin to see what works and why, but inversely you also peel away at the façade of things that don’t work and why don’t they work. That being said, I initially found learning and getting the hang of things intimidating. <br></br> HTML was not too bad, but the moment CSS and JavaScript came to the party I could feel my self being overwhelmed. I think that’s always the disconnect though, most don’t realize the importance of practicing programming and not just watching a tutorial or copying it from the web. It’s about taking what you have learnt and experimenting until the desired effect is reached, at least in my experience that’s what it’s about. I think when it came to actually designing my own website, that’s when the real problems started. I had so many ideas of what I wanted it to look like, and how I wanted it to function but getting to that outcome was the span in my works. This is where the creativity aspect came in, at least for me. I faced the issue of being severely out of my league and my element when it came to implement what I envisioned 100% so I had to make several sacrifices in the way of adding and removing certain elements. This was more my way of completing the website without it feeling bare bones and the fact that you're reading this now, means I didn't completely mess up right?
